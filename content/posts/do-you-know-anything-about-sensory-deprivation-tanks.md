Hey, how are you?

\-I’m fine. ~~I’m exhausted.~~

You seem tired.

\-It’s because of the flu. ~~I lack sleep.~~

Oh my. Just rest for a bit.

\-Will try. \~\~ I can’t.\~\~

Try resting now.

\-I have other things to do. ~~I just can’t.~~

What’s wrong?

\-Nothing, I’m fine. Just leave me be.  ~~Everything. My mind is a mess. It keeps on telling me that I’m not good enough and I will never be good enough.~~

I’m just trying to help.

\-Please, don’t. I’m okay. ~~Help me.~~

Are you sure? There must be something I can do to make you feel better.

Yes, I’m okay. ~~No. Help me disappear? Even just for a day or a week.~~

Okay. Goodbye.

Bye. ~~Please stay.~~
